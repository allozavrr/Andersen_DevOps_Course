# Hello my friend. This is my final final assignment for the exam.

My goal was to deploy two basic applications:

[The application "Hello World!"](https://github.com/allozavrr/Andersen_DevOps_Course/tree/main/exam/Python_app) to **Python**:
*  built with free services like code validation and Heroku
*  deployed with minimal configuration difficulties
*  has one automated test and code quality check

[The application "Hello World!"](https://github.com/allozavrr/Andersen_DevOps_Course/tree/main/exam/Go_app) to **Golang**:
*  built with Docker and Terraform
*  has two automated tests (traditional and tabular test)
*  includes logging services
*  can be deployed to Heroku, or with the help of Terraforms.

**Glory to the robots!** ~~Kill all people!~~
