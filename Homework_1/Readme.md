# My name is Alla.

I have this nickname on GitHub because I love ::dinosaurs:: :)

I work as a **system administrator** and am learning the **Go programming language**.

* **I'm interested in the DevOps course** because:
    * I like to learn everything new
    * I love information security and automation
    * as I said, my motto is to automate everything that moves, and if not, move and automate.

* ** What I expect from the DevOps course: **
    * understanding how the philosophy of DevOps works
    * skills in automation and scaling
    * analysis of practical cases
    * meeting people who love their job.

* **Today I learned:**
    * web development methodologies
    * how DevOps developed
