# My name is Alla.
I've got this nickname on GitHub because I love ðŸ¦–dinosaursðŸ¦• :)

I work a system administrator and I'm learning the Go programming language.

**I'm interested in the DevOps course because:**
    * I like to learn everything new
    * I like information security and automation
    * as I said, my motto is to automate everything that moves, and if it not, move and automate.

**What I expect from the DevOps course:**
    * understanding how the philosophy of DevOps works
    * skills in automation and scaling
    * analysis of practical cases
    * meeting people who love their job.
